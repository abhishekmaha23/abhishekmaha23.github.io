Hello!

I'm Abhishek, and I'm a scientist researcher currently working at the Data Ecosystems department in TNO.

I work on creating and publishing prototypes and demonstrations related to the following concepts:
- Data Space implementations applied in multiple domains

- Semantic models (implementing prototype systems with OWL and SHACL models used for live use-cases)

I'm passionate about the following:
- Self-sovereign identity
- Federated systems
- Zero knowledge proofs and other privacy enhancing technologies
- Large language models and Generative AI - potentially moving towards AGI

My skills include:
- Cloud architecture design/building solution architectures quickly
    - Kubernetes, Helm, Docker

- Full-stack development
    - Python, Java, Kotlin
- Databases
